				<h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
				
				<p><em>Giulia Balestra</em> was born and raised in Canada. She grew up with an Italian father and a Welsh mother she has learned a lot culturally. At an early age she learned that hard work meant success from seeing her family restaurant business’ thrive. Throughout high school she helped by working and learning business with her father. This was the foundation to her wanting to become a Graphic designer. She would help her family discuss business names, logos and even menus. She loved to think about design and draw on her spare time. She loves to travel and see what the world has to offer, culturally and especially enjoys cooking and trying new cuisine. </p>
						
				<h3><strong>Goals As A Designer</strong></h3>
				
				<p>Throughout the first year of the Graphic Design program at <em>Algonquin College</em>, she has learned a lot. She is excited to see what the next to years will bring, and to continue learning. She has a huge interest in the marketing aspect of design and would love to design billboards or even the packaging to products. She enjoys the psychology behind design and how it attracts people to buying the product. <em>Giulia</em> also enjoys designing creative logos for new business because that is what she enjoyed from the start, before she knew what Graphic Design was. Growing up and working in the restaurant business taught her the importance of customer satisfaction, and how communicating their needs are is a very important part of a happy customer. </p>
